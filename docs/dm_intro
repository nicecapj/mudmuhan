help current and future DMs maintain and run mordor.  This program
is menu driven, so just select the letter of the menu option of
interest.  Entering a 'Q' on a menu screen will exit the program.
Entering 'B' will exit a submenu back to the previous menu (provided
you are in a submenu).

While viewing a file:  hitting the space bar will scroll the document
up one line, hitting return will scroll the document up one screen,
and entering 'q' will quit back to a menu.
