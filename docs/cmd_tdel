TDEL COMMAND:

   The tdel command will list or delete all files that have not been 
modified in a specified number of days.  The number of days is
specified by the first command arguemnt of tdel.  Note: the number
of days can be a floating number (i.e. 2.2, 60.5, etc).

syntax:
    tdel <# of days> [-d] [-F <files ..>]

    -d  The '-d' flag requires tdel to delete all files that are
        X or more days old, where X is the specified number of days.

    -F  <files...> The '-F' requires tdel to list/delete the specified 
        files after the '-F' flag. If '-F' is not set, tdel will
        list / delete the files in the specifed directory (the
        path is hard coded and currently set to mordor/player/).
        Note: '-F' must appear as the last command flag, since
        all arguements following '-F' are assumed to be file names.
        The files are also assumed to in the current work directory,
        or a relative path to the current working directory
        The files are also assumed to in the current work directory,
        or a relative path to the current working directory.

    tdel 10

        modified in the last 10 days.
