	How to Create a Shop

A shop must always have a storage room associated with it.  The storage
room must be the next sequential room number.  The storage room is where
items are stored that will appear on the list in the shop.  Be sure to set
the room flag 13 in the storage room so that players cannot teleport there.

After the shop and storage room have been created, go to the storage room
and create one each of the items you want to appear in the shop's list.
Then, set both flags 9 and 10 for the item(s) and drop them on the floor.
And last, you must use the DM command *perm to make the items permanent.
NOTE:  If the game is being heavily used you may have to type *perm many
times.  You will get either a "failed" or "done" message each time.  Keep
trying until the "done" message appears.


EXAMPLE

You decide to make a room that sells only rings.

1.	Create a new room with your description.
	Set the shop flag.  flag 1.

2.	Create a storage room, exactly one room number higher.
	Set the no teleport flag.  flag 13.

3.	Log in to the game and go to the storage room.

4.	Use the DM command *c <ring number> to put a ring in your inventory.
	Set the two permanent flags.  flag 9 and flag 10.
	Use the DM command *set o ring f #

5.	At this point, you can change the value of the ring to be different
	than that set in the editor.  What ever you change it to will be the
	price set by the shop.
	Use the DM command *set o ring v <$$$>

6.	Drop the ring in the storage room.
	Use the DM command *perm.  (Continue until you get the "done" message.)

7.	Congratulations!  Now type list in the shop to check your handiwork.
