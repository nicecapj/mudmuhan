Help on command:

	*CNAME <creature> [#] [-dtk] <name>

	This will set the description, talk string, and keys for a 
monster.  This is very similar to the *ONAME command, except that it 
works on monsters and not objects.

example:
:*cn nobleman -d He's short and fat.
Description done.
	{sets the description on the nobleman}
:*cn gonzo -t Whoa! 
Talk String done.
	{sets the talk string on gonzo to Whoa!}
:*cn gonzo mordrak
Name done.
	{changes the name of gonzo to mordrak}
