INTRODUCTION
	Mordor is a MUD (Multi-User Dungeon).  It is a real time game
in which you can interact with other users.  The following is a brief
explanation of important commands and topics needed to succeed in this
game.  Some commands have multiple eqivalents and they will be listed
with commas separating them.  Variable arguments will be listed via
<argument>.

COMMAND LINE
	The game is command line driven, with a colon as its normal
prompt.  The command interpreter is an intelligent one.  Commands may
be given in upper and/or lowercase letters.  Abbreviations of commands
and its arguments may be used.  The partial/complete command given
will be searched through the available commands to find a unique
match.  If it is not a unique command, more information (letters) must
be given.

HELP
	Online help can be summoned by issuing the command 'help
<command>'.  If a command argument is given, specific information on
it will be listed, otherwise all the available commands will be
listed.

COMMUNICATION
	Since Mordor is a multi-user game, there needs to be some way
to talk to other players.  The following commands are used for
communication:
	"say <message>", ' <message>, " <message> : the message will
be sent to all the players in the same room.
	"yell <message>" : the message will be sent to all the players
in the same room and adjoining rooms.
	"tell <player> <message>", "send <player> <message>" : the
message will be sent to only the specific player identified.
	"broadcast <message>" : the message will be sent to all
players online Mordor.  A five broadcast per day quota is imposed on
each character.

MOVEMENT
	To move from one room to another, use the "go" command.
	"go <direction>" : direction is any valid exit to the current
room, which may be visible, hidden, or invisible.  Examples are "go
north", "go up", "go door".
	Instead of typing "go <direction>" all the time, certain
directions may be given as the command itself.  These command
directions include "north", "south", "east", "west", "northwest",
"northeast", "southwest", "southeast", "up", and "down".  The first
one or two letters of each of these command directions may be used as
a special abbreviation.  For example, use "n" instead of "north" (or
instead of "go north") and "ne" instead of "northeast".

INVENTORY/OBJECTS
	Each character is able to carry a limited amount of objects.
These objects include weapons, armor, scrolls, potions, gold, torches,
keys, and other items.  Each item (except gold) has a specific weight
value.  A character may not carry more than he/she can handle, which
depends on his/her class and level.
	"inventory" : lists all items currently in a character's
possession, but not worn, held, or wielded.
	"equipment" : lists all items currently worn, held, or
wielded.
	"get <item> [#] [from] [<item2>] [#]" : attempts to get an
item on the floor in the room and place it in the character's
inventory.  If <item2> is given, (i.e., a bag) then it will attempt to
get <item> from <item2> and place it in the character's inventory.
IMPORTANT: Refer to objects with only one name.  For example, if you
wish to get some cloth armor, type "get armor" or "get cloth".  Do not
type "get cloth armor" because the game will think the armor is a
container.
	"drop <item>" : removes the <item> from the character's
inventory and places it on the floor in the current room.
	Armor: an object which you wear on a specific part of a
character's body which contributes towards your Armor Class (AC)
value.  "wear <item>" will attempt to wear a specific item and will
succeed if it is an armor item, no other item is worn in its spot, and
it is not broken.  "wear all" is a shortcut which attempts to wear all
the items in your inventory (in the order that they appear).

*** HINTS FOR THE NEW PLAYER
	For the new player it is recommended that you create and operate 
your character using the following suggestions:

	1.  When creating your first character, choose the lawful option.
Isengard can be a violent place for the chaotic character, so it 
is recommended that you postpone being chaotic until you have learned 
your way around, and have learned some of the basic commands.

	2. Be sure to use the SET command to define the characteristics 
of your new character.  Your current settings can be seen by typing 'set' 
at the command prompt.  To see which characteristics can be set, you 
should type 'help set'.  In general, it is a good idea to 'set prompt' so 
that you have real-time information about your character.  Also, you 
should 'set long' so that you get all the information on each room you 
enter. 

	3.  When you encounter a new monster be sure to 'look' before 
interacting with it (this is, of course, unless it is

HINTS TO GET TO LEVEL 2
	Level 1 players should not attempt the arena or haunted house
until at least level 3 or without grouping with a level 4 or better
player.  Attack easy monsters such as students, scribes, monks, merchants,
laborers, and vagrants.  This can be accomplished by just hanging out
at Town Square, the University or a Pub where all of the non-agressive 
monsters arrive.  Make sure to watch your hitpoints with "sc".  It's not
recommended that you attack without close to full hitpoints.  Remember
that you must constantly attack with "k <monster>" every 3 seconds or
so.  Monsters will remember their enemies, so if you attack one and
flee (in which case you drop your wielded weapon), it will attack you
if you come back to that room.  After you reach level 2, you can do
some more exploring of the town.  The general rule is _look_ and _talk_ 
before attacking, and above all: BE CAREFUL.

If you have ANY questions or problems, first try asking a Caretaker. If
one is not available, ask one of the Dungeonmasters.
